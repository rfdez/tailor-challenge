# 🎯 Documentation Standard

## 💡 Convention

Every project convention must be documented as a standalone Markdown file inside the `docs/` folder, organized by area (`backend/`, `frontend/`, `infrastructure/`, `database/`, …). Each document follows a fixed structure with these sections in order: Convention, Benefits, Examples (good and bad), Real world examples, and Related agreements.

The goal is to provide AI agents and developers with self-contained, discoverable references that require no extra context to understand.

## 🏆 Benefits

- AI agents can consume individual docs without loading the entire knowledge base, reducing token usage.
- New team members find conventions faster through a browsable folder structure.
- Each doc is independently reviewable in PRs, making convention changes easy to track.
- The fixed structure ensures consistency and completeness across all documented conventions.

## 👀 Examples

### ✅ Good: Well-structured convention document with the ending sentence

```markdown
# 🎯 Name of the convention
